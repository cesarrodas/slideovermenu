    <h2>Hello</h2>
    <p>
      Happy&#39;s not a faucet that&#39;ll flow when a handle is turned
      I wanna handle my shit, but it hasn&#39;t occurred
      I need the stamina, keep on like my grandmama
      When I&#39;m not on camera I gotta be a man of my word
      And be a greater guy, not some thin-as-paper guy
      Like the times that Georgie Porgie kissed the girl
      And made her cry, saying, see ya later, bye
      Shit I say is pretty strange
      Coming back for Christmas and we bitch on how the city changed
      Fuck it, man, we&#39;re changing too, look at what we going through
      Mama used to buy me shirts she said that I would grow into
      But it&#39;s draping on me like an apron or a cape, a great tsunami wave of cotton that I&#39;m caught in that she bought at Ross—I know the cost of it was probably awesome but my style is sorta sloppy
      I&#39;ll fit it when I blossom like a California Poppy
      The tears are freezing on my cheek in Boston out in Copley
      And I don&#39;t really know why, no I don&#39;t really know why
    </p>
    <p>All you can do, is</p>
    <p>
      So pour that liquor out. I never chickened out
      But if I got to make a second pick I&#39;d take a different route
      But a grip of my decisions pretty Mickey Mouse
      I tried to join the 27 Club, they kicked me out
      It was like I&#39;m limping into heaven while my dick is out
      And there&#39;s Amy Winehouse sitting on a cloud and drinking stout
      But she spits it out the moment I come gliding in
      She&#39;s all like, “come on Joplin, who the fuck invited him?!
      Hide all of the Heinekens!" No, they don&#39;t know my name
      My heart is lowkey broken so I'm taking Novocain
      And Jimmy Morrison the doors, and Brian Jones, you know, the Stones
      Are joking, toking on a roach playing a poker game
      I know that I'm a bastard. The walls are alabaster
      Jimi plays his Stratocaster jamming out with Kurt Cobain
      They're playing Purple Rain, or maybe Purple Haze
      And Kurt says, “How the fuck they let this jerk in with his hurtful ways?”
      I try to jump and spread my wings like I'm a bird of prey
      But I hit the earth and break a mothafucka&#39;s vertebrate (hey)
      I guess I&#39;m fucking up the blueprint for success
      Woke up in the hospital with Jimi&#39;s bootprints on my chest
      This recklessness, no common senses
      I Kamikaze, there's consequences
      I don&#39;t condone it, but I did it, I&#39;ma own it
      I&#39;ve been living for the moment gotta go (go!)
      Cause
